**KubAnomaly_DataSet and model**

This project is used to detected some anomaly behavior in container.
We offer program and data set used in our paper

"KubAnomaly: Anomaly detection for the Docker
orchestration platform with neural network approaches"

[paper link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eng2.12080)


**Usage**

1. create a virtual environment 
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python KubAnomaly_Paper.py

then you can reproduce the experiment result 

P.S the result may have a slice different compare to our paper. 
    We think maybe is package version problem
